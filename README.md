- â˜› Use the Control Panel wall to play the game!  
- â˜› Once you remove the supplied items from the Chest, you will be given a set of tools, the chest will disappear, and the 13-minute timer will start ticking down!  
- â˜› Once the 13 minute Counter Timer runs out you will be snapped into Spectator mode, and can take screenies of your attempt!  
- â˜› Once you're ready to try again, switch to another gamemode using the [/gamemode](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/gamemode) command in chat or use `F3+F4` to choose any other gamemode so that you can push the buttons.
