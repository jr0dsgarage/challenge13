â˜› Use the Control Panel wall to play the game!   
â˜› Once you remove the supplied Items from the Chest, the chest will disappear, you will be magically teleported to the middle of the build area, and the 13-minute timer will start ticking down!  
â˜› Once the 13 minute Counter Timer runs out you will be snapped into Spectator mode, and can take screenies of your attempt!  
â˜› Once you're ready to try again, switch to another gamemode using the [/gamemode](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/gamemode) command in chat or use `F3+F4` to choose any other gamemode so that you can push the buttons.
